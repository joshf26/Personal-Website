        <br><br>
        <b>Features</b>
        <p>Your Subscription Service includes a domain and hosting for your website, an email address at your domain, file storage, SSL security, and access to services that provide real-time analytics, a blog, and online forms. The website's initial design, build and unlimited changes to your website are all included. Please note that changes to your website may take up to 2 weeks to complete. If JoshFrankl.in estimates that a requested change requires longer than 2 weeks to complete, you will be notified.</p>
        <b>First Year Requirement</b>
        <p>The first year of your subscription service must be paid up front. An invoice of $828 (for the "Website" plan) or $1188 (for the "Web App" plan) (plan details available <a href="/web" target="_blank">here</a>) will be sent and must be paid before your website goes live. After the first year, you may continue paying invoices either monthly or yearly.</p>
        <b>Right to Withdraw</b>
        <p>JoshFrankl.in has the right to cancel subscription service plans at anytime. You will be refunded for the current month at the time of cancellation. If the cancellation occurs during the year after paying a yearly invoice, you will be refunded for the current month plus all months left in the year. For example, if your yearly invoice started in January and the cancellation occurred in May, you will be refunded for 8 months, not 7. You will NOT be refunded if you are the one who decides to cancel the subscription service.</p>
        <b>Ownership After Cancelation</b>
        <p>If either you or JoshFrankl.in decides the cancel the subscription service, you will have the rights to your website's source code, domain, and Google Apps account (which includes email, Google Drive, and analytics). However, there is no guarantee that your website will function properly on hosts other than JoshFrankl.in.</p>
