        <h1>&#128075; Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my ePortfolio. This is where you will find my submissions for the ePortfolio project for CU Boulder's ASEN 1969 - Pathway to Space course.</p>

        <h1>&#128221; Resume</h1>
        <p>You can find a PDF copy of my Resume <a href="/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. If you're familiar with CLIs, check out my <a href="/resume" target="_blank">interactive resume</a>.</p>
        <iframe src="/resume.pdf" width="100%" height="800px"></iframe>

        <h1>&#128301; Vision Statement</h1>
        <p>Every problem has a solution, but finding it can be very challenging. This challenge is what drives me to work hard. In computer science and in space, there are so many problems that need solving. I hope to one day solve a revolutionary problem that no one has solved before.</p>

        <h1>&#127918; Sample of Work</h1>
        <p>To see a sample of my work, try the trivia game I created called "Orders of Magnitude".</p>
        <div class="center">
            <a href="game" class="btn btn-large red">Play Orders Of Magnitude</a>
        </div>

        <h1>&#128188; Community Service</h1>
        <p>For my community service, I helped out the Office of Information Technology here at CU Boulder on April 16th 2020. This session was held remotely, so I was at home in Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The activity was to answer questions on and provide feedback for various aspects of the new Buff Portal. They asked me questions like how I would attempt to find information, what I liked and disliked about various designs, and more. Overall, it went very well and I felt I was able to provide valuable feedback to their team. I chose this activity because my original community service idea was cancelled due to the Coronavirus. As for the impact I made, they will be using my suggestions and feedback to make the Buff Portal better, which will make finding and using school services much easier for future students. After the session, they told me they really valued my feedback and said it will be very useful for them.</p>
        <p>After the activity, I felt great that I was able to help. As for connections, I now feel comfortable approaching the people I helped about jobs or internships in the future at CUâ€™s IT department. While I do not currently have plans to do future community service, I always want to give back to the community and help out when I can. Opportunities like this assignment give me a head start to actually take these actions.</p>
